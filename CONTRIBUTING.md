        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part

### Reporting Bugs


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/siemens/simatic-s7-1500-tm-fast-vhdl-application-examples/issues) to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching the open issues of this repository.
- Check the closed issues for solutions to problems other users had.
- If you're unable to find an issue addressing your problem, open a new issue. (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

#### Issue workflow

- The project team will label the issue accordingly. `Workflow: Issue created`
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` label will not be addressed until the steps to reproduce it have been provided.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `type: bug` and `Workflow: Approved`, as well as possibly other labels (such as `type: enhancement`)
- If work on the issue has begun the workflow label will be changed to `Workflow: In progress`


### Suggesting Enhancements

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Check the available examples carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/siemens/simatic-s7-1500-tm-fast-vhdl-application-examples/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/siemens/simatic-s7-1500-tm-fast-vhdl-application-examples/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. 
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most TM FAST users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## Thank you!
